(Currently in heavy development and thus not functional.)  Not all Android phones can access Google Assistant when the screen is off. If you have a Bluetooth headset or a pair of audio smartglasses that does not have a Google Assist button, this means you cannot access Google Assistant without first waking up the phone manually.   This app is designed to address this by pretending to be a media player to allow you to control it with common media buttons (volume and play/pause) and acts as an intermediate assistant. This assistant can launch Google Assistant or other apps defined by the user.
